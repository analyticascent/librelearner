# LibreLearner Whitepaper
#### *Convey + Collaborate + Certify*

&nbsp;

**Executive Summary:** LibreLearner is a [decentralized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) platform that unbundles in-person education from fixed locations, grade levels, and a variety of other traditional constraints. It can be used as a supplementary tool for existing schooling or a stand-alone application that aims to bring the cost of traditional K-12 education to as close to zero as possible. The software itself will be available for free, while potential revenue sources will include enterprise services for schools that wish to reduce or eliminate curricular costs, as well as validating any credentials users may have that wish to offer tutoring services of some kind to others on the platform.

If successful, this project will lead to a self-sustaining ecosystem that fully decentralizes three critical functions of schooling: conveying information, collaborating with peers, and certifying subject mastery.
