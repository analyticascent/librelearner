# LibreLearner Whitepaper
#### *Convey + Collaborate + Certify*

&nbsp;

**Executive Summary:** LibreLearner is a [decentralized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) platform that unbundles in-person education from fixed locations, grade levels, and a variety of other traditional constraints. It can be used as a supplementary tool for existing schooling or a stand-alone application that aims to bring the cost of traditional K-12 education to as close to zero as possible. The software itself will be available for free, while potential revenue sources will include enterprise services for schools that wish to reduce or eliminate curricular costs, as well as validating any credentials users may have that wish to offer tutoring services of some kind to others on the platform.

If successful, this project will lead to a self-sustaining ecosystem that fully decentralizes three critical functions of schooling: conveying information, collaborating with peers, and certifying subject mastery.

## 0. General Overview:

**Summary:** Education can largely be thought of as a blend of *conveying* information, *collaboration* with peers, and *certifying* what students know. An effective approach can accommodate the needs of students, instructors, and existing schools if a demand for brick-and-mortar facilities exists. This section (**General Overview**) will go over questions relevant to a hypothetical investor.

## 1. Features & Development

**Summary:** LibreLearner as a (free) *product* is a decentralized application. The *revenue model* is a mix of premium and consulting services for groups or education institutions that hope to deliver more effective schooling at a lower cost to parents and students. What features will ultimately be included depends on the needs of individual users as well as schools that hope to utilize it.

## 2. Our Market & Competitors

**Summary:** At this time only indirect competitors have come to our attention. To date, no fully peer-to-peer application offered at no cost to individual users of this kind has been developed. Most "edtech" applications or services focus on very limited tasks, and limit their focus to what traditional public schools may find of utility. Here we go over who our target userbase is as well as why no competitor would be able to enter the same market without indirectly helping our growth.

## 3. Marketing & Revenue

**Summary:** This section builds off the previous one by focusing on how we intend to grow in our target markets and how revenue will be generated from that adoption. Because most "edtech" firms are focused on getting special access to adoption by public school systems, they are artifically limited in how they attract new users, and revenue is far more likely to reflect special connections they may have rather than the true value they offer to users.

## 4. Objections Answered

**Summary:** Education has always been a contentious issue in both public policy as well as society as a whole. And within Silicon Valley circles, it has been seen as one of the most challenging areas to innovate in due to existing special interests. This section addresses criticism about LibreLearner itself, as well as the political or legal challenges it may face. Broadly speaking, we aim to have something that appeals to parents/students, instructors, and schools regardless of whether they are public, private, or homeschooling "co-ops" that act as such.

## 5. What To Do Now

**Summary:** At the time of this writing, the team consists of one dedicated person with other connections that may join later on. An MVP is in the works, and if certain hypotheses are confirmed features will be added to the software stack accordingly. If all goes well, a minimum-viable "execution" (in which a functional product, early adopters, and predictable revenue streams all come into place) will sucessfully form and we can then give investors a clear idea of what our earn/burn/churn rates are.

*Before talking to investors directly, we hope to run a crowdfunding campaign to fund our seed round and put an early software iteration of LibreLearner to the test.*
