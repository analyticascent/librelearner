# Librelearner

**Nov 30th 2018 Note:** *This project is on near-permanent hiatus until other projects of mine get underway or improved enough to not warrant being the primary focus of my spare time. For now I want to see 1) how the landscape of dApp development plays out over the next eighteen months, and 2) test out some of the features of this project that don't require any code to validate their utility.*

*I don't know when I'll start gathering a team for this, but for now your best bet is to watch this repo for updates.*

A proof of concept to illustrate how K-12 education could be provided at a near zero cost. This is currently in the planning stages, but anyone interested in what's to come can view the [MVP draft file](https://github.com/analyticascent/librelearner/raw/master/mvp%20draft.pdf).

Broadly speaking, the goal is to create an app that better facilitates how subject information is **conveyed**, automates how geospatially proximate users **collaborate** with each other in study groups, and decentralizes how we **certify** what a user has learned.
