# Librelearner
A proof of concept to illustrate how K-12 education could be provided at a near zero cost. This is currently in the planning stages, but anyone interested in what's to come can view the [MVP draft file](https://github.com/analyticascent/librelearner/raw/master/mvp%20draft.pdf).

Broadly speaking, the goal is to create an app that better facilitates how subject information is **conveyed**, automates how geospatially proximate users **collaborate** with each other in study groups, and decentralizes how we **certify** what a user has learned.
